RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_1,Some monsters are actually pretty shy. [pause]I think I can relate.
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_2,"{player}, have you ever tried being a Traffikrab? [pause]Like [wave amp=30 freq=10]really being[/wave] a Traffikrab?"
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_3,It's an experience.
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_4,Hey there! [pause]Record anything interesting today?
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_5,There have been more floods lately. 
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_6,Sometimes[pause] I just like dashing through the forest! 
RECRUIT_IDLE_DIALOG_7,"I picked up a strange sticker the other day.[pause] It doesn't seem to do anything, but my opponent always looks [wave amp=30 freq=10]so annoyed[/wave]!"

RECRUIT_MENU_OPTION4,Goodbye!
RECREUIT_MENU_PLAYCARDS1,A card game on a weird interdimensional island filled with dangerous monsters?[pause][pause] Of course I'll play!
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_LOSE1,"Aw, dang it. I gotta find better cards."
RECRUIT_PLAYCARDS_WIN1,"It's all in the heart of the cards, you know?"
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_ACCEPT1,"Sure, I've got some free time!"
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_ACCEPT2,"I guess I can lend a hand, if you [wave amp=30 freq=10]really[/wave] need it."
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_ACCEPT3,"We're not doing anything too dangerous[pause], are we?"
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_REJECT1,"It seems like you've got your hands full, maybe later! "
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_REJECT2,I'm a bit anxious around this many people. Can we hang out some other time?
RECRUIT_MENU_INVITE_REJECT3,Lose the extra pair of hands first.
RECRUIT_MENU_GOODBYE1,See you around!
RECRUIT_MENU_GOODBYE2,"Don't go too far, in case I need help…"
RECRUIT_MENU_GOODBYE3,"Fine, I was in the middle of something anyway. "
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_ACCEPT1,"Sure, I could use the warm up!"
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_ACCEPT2,"Alright, but don't blame me for what happens next."
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_ACCEPT3,"You'll go easy on me[pause], right?"
RECRUIT_CHALLENGE_WIN1,That was more of a workout than I expected!
RECRUIT_CHALLENGE_WIN2,I was still getting warmed up.
RECRUIT_CHALLENGE_WIN3,"{player}, you really don't pull your punches do you?"
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_REJECT1,I'm still catching my breath from our last round! Maybe we can go again tomorrow?
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_REJECT2,Are you [wave amp=30 freq=10]trying[/wave] to humiliate me? Go pick on somebody else for a while.
RECRUIT_MENU_CHALLENGE_REJECT3,"I don't think I can keep up with you, {player}. I need some time to rethink my strategy!"

FOLLOWER_IDLE_DIALOG3,I heard some weird stuff happens here in {region_name}. Maybe we can wrap up and go hang out at the Café?
FOLLOWER_IDLE_DIALOG4,How long have you been using that {first_tape_name} tape? We should go record one for me to try out!

RECRUIT_TRADE_OFFER2,I've been looking everywhere for [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color]! If you're interested I'll trade [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] for it.
RECRUIT_TRADE_OFFER3,"If you've got any spare [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] stickers laying around, I'll gladly give you my [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] for it."
RECRUIT_TRADE_OFFER4,"[color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] is the missing piece to my perfect winning strategy! You can have [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] for it, if you promise not to tell anybody about my amazing setup!"
RECRUIT_TRADE_OFFER5,Would you be willing to trade [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] for my [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] sticker?
RECRUIT_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,"Finally, this [color=#{request_rarity}]{trade_request}[/color] sticker will make me invincible!"

RECRUIT_TRADE_REJECTED2,If you didn't have [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] all you had to do was say so…
RECRUIT_TRADE_REJECTED3,What am I supposed to do with this? I really needed [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] to complete my collection!
RECRUIT_TRADE_MENU_OPTION1,"Sure, here you go!"
RECRUIT_TRADE_MENU_OPTION2,No way!
RECRUIT_TRADE_CANCEL1,Dang it! Now what am I going to do?!
RECRUIT_TRADE_CANCEL2,"Oh, okay. Thanks for considering it."

EUGENE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,"I was thinking of trying out a few new battle poses later. [pause] What? Don’t give me that look, it's totally important!"
EUGENE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,"We gotta do more supply runs, can't afford to run low on tapes out there!"

FELIX_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG1,Hey there {player}. Not working too hard I hope?
FELIX_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG2,"I sketeched another monster the other day. Their anatomy was so unorthodox, I couldn't help but get inspired. "
FELIX_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG3,"I broke another pencil rewinding my tape today[pause]. I always keep a spare[pause], but I usually save it for my sketches. "
FELIX_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,"You know[pause], it's not so bad here![pause] Wild monsters aside[pause], it's actually pretty relaxing."
FELIX_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,Hey.[pause] I was just enjoying the weather.

FELIX_TRADE_OFFER1,I could use an extra [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] sticker.[pause] Maybe you'd be willing to trade for my [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] sticker?
FELIX_TRADE_REJECTED1,"Hmm[pause], I don't think that's it.[pause] That's alright, I can probably get it from the merchant stalls."
FELIX_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,"This should smooth things out for me.[pause] I appreciate it, {player}. "
FELIX_CARDS_ACCEPT1,Woah![pause] Check out the artwork on these cards.[pause] Wanna play a round?
FELIX_CARDS_LOSE1,"Nice[pause], good game {player}.[pause] Here's one of my cards[pause], have fun."

MEREDITH_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG3,"Hey, {player}. Did you need something?"
MEREDITH_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,"Some[pause], uh[pause], odd stuff has been washing up on the beach lately."
MEREDITH_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,I really wanted a new tape today.
MEREDITH_CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED1,"Urgh. Fine. I'll humor you this one time, mate."
MEREDITH_CHALLENGE_REJECTED1,"I've, uh, got something I gotta do first, mate."
MEREDITH_CHALLENGE_WIN1,"Alright, mate. You earned that one."
MEREDITH_TRADE_OFFER1,"So, if you've got any [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] stickers laying around.[pause] I wouldn't mind trading my [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] for it. If you're interested."
MEREDITH_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,"Thanks, mate. I needed this one."
MEREDITH_TRADE_REJECTED1,"Urgh. I'm, uh, pretty sure I was clear on which bloody sticker I needed."
MEREDITH_TRADE_CANCEL1,"Yeah[pause], I figured as much."
MEREDITH_CARDS_ACCEPT1,"Somebody made a card game?[pause] Yeah[pause], ok[pause], I guess we may as well play."
MEREDITH_CARDS_LOSE1,"Well[pause], that was[pause] interesting.[pause]I guess[pause], here's your reward."
MEREDITH_CARDS_WIN1,"Heh[pause], I guess I'm pretty good at this."
MEREDITH_LEAVE1,"Take care, mate."
MEREDITH_PASSIVE_ROGUES_MESSAGE1,Ugh! Not again! Let's just… urgh! Somebody help me out here!

VIOLA_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,May this day find you well!
VIOLA_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,Greetings friend!
VIOLA_CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED1,You mean to test thy mettle against a worthy opponent? I humbly accept your request!
VIOLA_CHALLENGE_REJECTED1,"Alas, I fear my current condition would not make our sparring worthwhile. I require a moment of respite."
VIOLA_CHALLENGE_WIN1,"Pray tell, where did you learn such impressive feats?"
VIOLA_TRADE_OFFER1,"If I may, I require one [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] sticker to improve upon my current ability. If you would be willing to part with one, I offer thee my [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] in exchange!"
VIOLA_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,You have my gratitude!
VIOLA_TRADE_REJECTED1,"Alas, dear friend. This does not resemble the item I requested."
VIOLA_TRADE_CANCEL1,"Fear not, I am resourceful enough to procure one through other means!"
VIOLA_LEAVE1,Fare thee well!
VIOLA_CARDS_ACCEPT1,A game of chance and skill played on small sheets of paper?[pause] How fascinating! 
VIOLA_CARDS_LOSE1,Marvelous! I do believe it is customary to reward the victor with a card from the defeated's arsenal?
VIOLA_CARDS_WIN1,How joyous! I would gladly engage in more of these leisure activities!
VIOLA_PASSIVE_ROGUES_MESSAGE1,Rogues have been sighted upon the horizon! Let us show thy fiends our true mettle!
FRANKIE_CARDS_ACCEPT1,Oh oh oh! I've played tons of these back home! 
FRANKIE_CARDS_LOSE1,Yes! Ha ha! I've still got it!
FRANKIE_CARDS_WIN1,"You were amazing![pause][pause]Ok ok, [wave amp=30 freq=10]Duelist Kingdom[/wave] rules apply so here's one of my cards! "
FRANKIE_PARTY_INVITE1,Joining the hero's party?! I'm another step closer to legendary status!
FRANKIE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG1,"I accept all quests, no matter [wave amp=30 freq=10]how[/wave] small![pause] You never know which one will move the plot forward!"
FRANKIE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG2,"You know[pause], usually in these kinds of Isekai I would have some unique ability or abnormally high stat![pause] Vin didn't seem to get it either…"
FRANKIE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG3,"In another world as {frankie_tape}! It's a pretty catchy title, right?!"
FRANKIE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,"We should write our own theme song![pause][pause] Something catchy like Card Captors![pause]…You had Card Captors on your world[pause], right?"
FRANKIE_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,"I tried rewinding my tape with my pinkie[pause], but for some reason it still didn't work… [pause]It's like there's some weird [wave amp=30 freq=10]game logic[/wave] that forces me to use pencils!"
FRANKIE_CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED1,I've had a lot of time to train [wave amp=30 freq=10]off screen[/wave]![pause] That means it's time to show off my new special attack![pause][wave amp=30 freq=10] {frankie_attack}![/wave]
FRANKIE_CHALLENGE_REJECTED1,I need to finish my training montage first!
FRANKIE_CHALLENGE_WIN1,Ow…[pause] I think I bit my tongue. 
FRANKIE_TRADE_OFFER1,"If I could just get my hands on 1 more [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] sticker, my PvP build would be [wave amp=30 freq=10]so broken[/wave]! I've got an extra [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] I can trade for it!"
FRANKIE_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,Yes! Finally! I'm completely unstoppable now! [pause]You don't know what PvP is do you...?
FRANKIE_TRADE_REJECTED1,"{player}[pause], I know[pause] that you know[pause] that's not the right sticker…[pause] It's like you're just testing dialog options in a Visual Novel."
FRANKIE_TRADE_CANCEL1,Back to the grind then.
FRANKIE_LEAVE1,See ya!
FRANKIE_PASSIVE_ROGUES_MESSAGE1,[wave amp=30 freq=10]Ahhhh!!![/wave] I'm making a big heroic entrance! 
VIN_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG1,I can't decide between Headshot and Last Rites…
VIN_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG2,Mourningtown has been trying to get more involved in day to day Ranger activities. [pause]I'm going to keep doing my part!
VIN_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG3,Training has been so hard lately![pause] I don't know where Frankie gets all that energy from.
VIN_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG4,"I'm going to get stronger! I'll make sure Mourningtown can hold their heads up high again, one day."
VIN_IDLE_RECRUIT_DIALOG5,"Hey {player}, did you need something?"
VIN_CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED1,I'll show you how strong I've become!
VIN_CHALLENGE_REJECTED1,I think I sprained something. Let's pick this up again later.
VIN_CHALLENGE_WIN1,Dang it. I was so sure I had you that time!
VIN_TRADE_OFFER1,The [color=#{request_rarity}][{trade_request}][/color] sticker would go well in my setup. I'll give you [color=#{offer_rarity}][{trade_offer}][/color] for one if you've got any.
VIN_TRADE_ACCEPTED1,Great! I'll be taking down Rogues solo in no time with this setup!
VIN_TRADE_REJECTED1,That's not it. I'll just get it myself.
VIN_TRADE_CANCEL1,"Alright, thanks for checking. "
VIN_LEAVE1,See ya around.
VIN_PASSIVE_ROGUES_MESSAGE1,I'll put this Rogue down in no time!
VIN_CARDS_ACCEPT1,"I uh..[pause] What?[pause][pause] Alright, I guess I'll play."
VIN_CARDS_WIN1,"Hey, I'm not half bad at this!"
VIN_CARDS_LOSE1,"Well[pause], I didn't really know what I was doing there."
